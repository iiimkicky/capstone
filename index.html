            A year had gone by since the shimmering white cars with blue strips first started carrying passengers back and forth across the bay. As a staple of modernity, this scene fitted in city officials’ imagination of a cosmopolitan that is comparable to London, Paris and New York. Residents in the Bay Area would read on their newspaper about varied opinions on this hefty regional transportation initiative, and specifically, voices from the minority communities that are in stark contrast with city planners’ outlook of the future. Kids in the Mission would wake up to the sound of the train that constantly reminded them of their insignificance. They would play outside, in front of walls with “DERAIL B.A.R.T” painted on them. And perhaps before they noticed, a neighborhood of unique ethnic diversity that their working class parents used to enjoy living in would have disappeared as the city planners. This picture (Figure 1) appeared on San Francisco Bay Guardian in 1973 with an article title with strong dissatisfaction -- “BART: Forcing The Mission Underground.” For the Mission district, a neighborhood of working-class and ethnic diversity, the construction and operation of BART turned out to impose devastating impacts. People residing in the Mission district were working in the same neighborhood, and the advent of BART - along with the fancy facilities and rising property price that it implied - raised serious concerns of job loss.

          <h3>Historiography of Public Transport Systems in the US </h3>
          <p>
            Public transit system has been a strategic site to investigate urban history. As urban development leads to the need for mass transportation, transit systems also shape the city’s spatial equality and future growth trajectory. To gain a holistic view of BART's planning and impact, we must contextualize it with the backdrop of all the changes in mass transit systems and their relationships to urban development. Archivist Jay Young offers a thorough review of mass transit systems from the early 19th century to late 20th Century in urban areas of US. Young approaches the beginning of mass transit system from the perspective of technology breakthrough: cable car replaced horsecar (which first took place in San Francisco), and then electric streetcar took over omnibus and horse car. The wide adoption of electricity not only supplied energy to streetcars but also powered the economy by raising land prices in the center, expanding city boundaries and ultimately led to “the new scale of suburbanization,” a hallmark of American urban development. At the turn of the 20th century, another technological advancement called automobile stormed the street. Transportation historian Peter Norton's book Fighting Traffic: The Dawn of the Motor Age in the American City told a compelling story of the decline of the public transit and the rise of “Motordom.” While Norton covered events such as policy changes, he steered much attention on the urban experience of different social group in early 1900s and reconstructed the street as a contested space to reflect the shift in the mentalité of American city dwellers of the time: streets were no longer to be shared as a social space primarily. Adopting a cultural history framework, Norton explained how people’s changing perceptions of streets and freedom have culminated in the rise of the automobile revolution and consequently the decline of public transit systems.
          </p>
          <p>
            Young continued his line of analysis of the automobile revolution, specifically with the Interstate Highway System that “bequeathed to later generations of urban Americans a myriad of problems, including suburban sprawl, air pollution, snarled traffic, a dearth of mass transit, and an over-reliance on dwindling supplies of inexpensive petroleum.”  These critical social, spatial, environmental and economic urban context that set the stage for the comeback of mass transit systems in the 1960s.</p>
          <p>
            Although concerns of declining central areas due to suburban sprawl and later on pollution and energy crisis were mounting, due to the public nature of transit system, political power is still especially crucial in determining its fate. Finally, in 1964, the Urban Mass Transportation Act (UMTA) was passed, and the federal funding would then set off a plethora of publicly-owned transit projects across the states to either improve the services or establish new systems. </p>
          <p>
            Positing the construction of mass transit system in American’s enthusiasm about the automobile remains an essential angle that historians of transportation and urban development took. Zachary Schrag’s The Great Society Subway focused on the political force and public participation that battle against the overpowering automobile culture on various levels. “As an exemplary case of federal transportation policy..., [the DC] Metro came to symbolize not only a rare triumph of mass transit in the United States but also a revelation of the raw power of federal “politics and ideology” to shape debates about the appropriate form of transportation infrastructure.” Schrag recounted the conflicts and negotiations that the construction of DC metro ran into with local neighborhoods, and the impact on the development of the station-area. The planning and construction of the DC metro were historicized in a rather positive light as a system exemplified democracy and compassion, and its dramatic role in helping the government constructing the “modern life” of residents in DC. However, Schrag did point out the hasty drafts that planners made for the local control to race the federal authority, and the highway lobbyists continue to plague the system today on multiple levels.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is fair to compare BART with DC metro in the sense that both share inadequate planning that backfired in operation. Both systems experienced complicated power play during the planning phase, although for different reasons - DC was influenced by its surrounding state powers, and BART was contested as regional transit that needs to accommodate the different cities it connects. Conceptualized in a regional context to solve traffic congestion and put San Francisco on the league of subway cities, BART was designed to use space-age technology that speeds the bay area into modernity. However, this then-promising system winded up as one of the 10 “greatest planning disasters” written by Urbanist Peter Hall.  </p>
          <p>
            As the quintessential symbol in both the history of public transit and urban life in the US, the New York City Subway has seen a wealth of secondary sources of itself. While the social, political and spatial dimensions of New York City’s Subway system have received much attention, many historians also adopted an anthropological approach to its complicated relationships with urbanism and modernity and on the granularity of the individuals. Clifton Hood’s monograph “Changing Perceptions of Public Space On the New York Rapid Transit System” is one such example where the new social experience brought by the new transit system and the ramifications of the experience were closely studied. French ethnographer Stéphane Tonnelat and a native New Yorker William Kornblum also presented a compelling cultural history in International Express: New Yorkers on the 7 Train, where the 7 Train was studied as a microcosm of the quintessential New Yorker experience: people from all cultures and background are found to be sharing a confined space and establish a set of shared norms leading to a practical cosmopolitanism. Aside from using empirical methodologies to analyze the sociological effect of the transit system on the diversity and density of the city through ridership and population statistics, Tonnelat and Kornblum took an anthropological lens to focus on the riding experience on the 7 Train through interviews and diaries studies and concluded that the New York’s subway created a “situational community” that facilitated riders to become more competent urbanites, “adept at navigating diversity in public space, at scanning and reading the subway’s human landscape, at adopting the right footing, and at participating in the social order of dense and diverse crowds.”
          </p>
          <p>
            At the end of Young’s overview, he critiqued the lack of attention to the history of more recent transit systems, evident in the wealth of sources on streetcars, automobiles and the nearing-200-year-old subway in New York. “To give one example, no extensive study examines San Francisco’s BART—one of the largest megaprojects of the 1960s and 1970s—from a historical perspective”, which is one gap that I hope to fill with this essay.  Another missing piece from other historians’ writing on transportation is how public transit impact on the non-riders and local communities - the population that was not served by the railway but was nonetheless affected as transportation rewires the city. Their struggles and resistances have not been given a fair account in the broader history of public transit. In the case of BART, this means studying how the lives of the working poor in the Mission or other minority neighborhood were impacted by a transit system that they could not afford or had no need of using.
